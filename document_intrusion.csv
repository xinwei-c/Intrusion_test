I really want a child at some point but I want to adopt, I’ve always knew that since I was a child. My fiancé, on the other hand, says he wants to raise his own child that looks like me and him. So I agreed but every month when I get my period, I feel relieved.   A year ago I got severe bleeding that continued for two weeks. According to my gynaecologist, that was a potential pregnancy that my body rejected. She said that it’s different than miscarriage because there has been no pregnancy. It’s confusing but I didn’t ask more questions because the truth is, I didn’t care. I was actually relieved. My fiancé always talks about how he can’t wait for me to get pregnant but I hate the idea. I’ve told him I feel the same way but I’m lying. I told him a few times I wanted to adopt a child at some point and he refused. I myself am adopted and I don’t think my parents don’t love me, quite the contrary - they’ve always given me everything to the point I became quite spoiled. They are the most amazing parents I know so I don’t know how my fiancé can claim that adopted children aren’t ‘your own’ and ‘you can’t love them the same way as if they were your own’.  Since we’ve been trying for a child for quite some time and it’s not happening, he suggested we both go to a doctor and see what’s wrong. AITA for secretly hoping something really is wrong so I don’t have to bear a child? I feel so guilty and selfish but I did agree to carry his child. I just hope I’m physically unable to do it.   EDIT: Thanks for the engagement! Yes, I’ve suggested surrogacy but he is strongly against it. And I haven’t been exactly lying to him - I’ve told him I don’t want to give birth at the beginning of our relationship but he brushed it off. He claimed I was too young to know what I want. If I get pregnant, I’ll carry the child and love it when it’s born. I would certainly not blame it, nor I’ll blame my fiancé since for the past year and a half I haven’t said anything except suggesting surrogacy once. I love kids, I work with them and they are my life but I don’t think he realises how much I’m afraid. I remember when we started dating I told him that I’d rather cut off my arm than give birth but probably he thought I wasn’t serious.  EDIT 2: I’ve been reading all the comments and I agree that maybe I wasn’t clear enough with him. The fear is not only of giving birth (because there is always the C-section option) but the pregnancy itself. I am afraid of carrying a baby for 9 months. It’s not just that I don’t want to destroy my body - the thought of a human growing inside me terrifies me more than anything. And I’m not too young, I mean I was when we started dating but I’m 25 and I seriously doubt that I’d change my mind someday.', 'I\'m on mobile so the formatting might be a bit shit. I know the title makes it seem like an instant YTA and the fake names might make it seem like a shitpost but I can\'t think of any names that aren\'t too similar to the people involved or anyone I know.    I(26M) have been wanting to watch Detective Pikachu for the past few weeks. Unfortunately for me, after asking out 4 different groups of friends and my girlfriend (24F let\'s call her Joy), everyone is a lot more interested in Endgame. With John Wick releasing last week, I\'m probably gonna have to wait till Detective Pikachu releases on Netflix because the hype will switch over to John Wick. The following started last weekend and the ""date"" is supposed to be tomorrow (24/05)  After a bit of pestering and getting an adamant no from Joy, I jokingly told her ""Fine, I\'ll just go on Tinder"" only to get a ""Hah, like that\'ll work out"". So I downloaded Tinder, where my profile was from 3~4 years ago, changed only the bio to ""I just don\'t wanna watch Detective Pikachu alone"" and got to swiping semi-seriously till I fell asleep.  For context, (I think) dating apps aren\'t exactly a thing where I\'m from and (I think) I\'m only above average in terms of appearance so expectations were low. So imagine my surprise when I wake up to a match (23F let\'s call her Jenny) asking whether or not I was serious about the movie. I excitedly said yes, asked when she was available and where she lived/worked so we could go to a theatre that wasn\'t too far away from our places/workplaces depending on the situation.  It didn\'t occur to me that I should tell Jenny that I\'m in a relationship until I told Joy about the match. Throughout the entire time, I thought Joy was ok with it. She joked about how I\'ll end up watching the movie alone once I told Jenny. I came clean to Jenny ASAP and told her that if she was still interested, I\'d pay for the tickets, popcorn, drinks, etc. and the ""date"" was still on. Normally, I wouldn\'t do this but I admit I was tunnel visioning pretty hard. I probably shouldn\'t have assumed it from Joy\'s replies but I also told Jenny that Joy was ok with it since it\'s just a movie and dinner (might as well right?)  Fast forward to yesterday, we were having dinner and I showed Jenny\'s Instagram to Joy. This is probably where I might be TA for possibly making Joy insecure by commenting on how gorgeous Jenny is (a sentiment that Joy vocalised first) garnished with an ""I didn\'t think I could land an 8.5"".  After desserts, I felt like Joy was giving me the cold shoulder. Nothing aside from a goodbye and no ""I just got home"" text from her. Till today, Joy hadn\'t replied to several of my texts asking her how work was, etc.  I\'ve also asked if she objects to the ""date"" with Jenny just to be sure. No reply still. I\'m still planning to watch the movie tomorrow. Joy might have just been too preoccupied/tired to reply. Am I over thinking this or WIBTA if I followed through on the ""date""?', 'UPDATE; I’ve decided that I won’t go to SIL but I will tell my husband that we need to have time to ourself on the occasion, date nights once a week rather than twice a month.  I’ve decided to speak to SIL and ask if there’s anyway I can support her    My (42F) husband (40M) has a younger sister (26F) they’ve always been super close and we’d always have a meal out with SIL and her girlfriend once or twice a month, so we’re all close.   SIL became pregnant, we didn’t even realise she was planning on getting a donor as her and her girlfriend seemed so adamant against having children, she only told me a month before that she didn’t want children.  She carried the child for 8 months when she gave birth, the child passed away 2 days later.  Ever since then she’s always been around my home, she’s clinging on to my husband like nobody’s business, he’s even started to sleep around her place some nights, wherever my husband is my SIL is, now I’m sure if we had children she’d be priority over them too.  I get she lost a child, I’m not unsympathetic I’ve had a miscarriage before so I understand.   I’ve told my husband that he needs to start spending more time at home, we were planning on adopting a child and we can’t do that if our marriage isn’t sound, SIL has her girlfriend and parents   I’m not saying he should cut her off completely I just don’t think she should be at our home 7 days a week for 24hrs   He ignored me calling me a selfish AH, whatever, and that he wouldn’t tell his sister anything but I’m welcome to, I’d be an AH for doing it though    WIBTA for going directly to his sister ?', 'Throwaway account because people from our town would know who we are.  My wife and I were both brought up in very conservative christian homes. We’ve known each other since early childhood and were married three years ago at 19. We’re both christians but neither of us are anywhere near as conservative as our parents and don’t plan to lead the same type of lives as they have. Our marriage is great, we love each other a great deal and always talk about how we feel.  Anyway: We told everyone that we weren’t going to prevent pregnancies when we were married but as my wife had just started college and neither of us felt ready to start a family, my wife had an IUD. Up until today, we’ve told everyone that we’re trying but that God just hasn’t given us a baby yet. Obviously there (most likely) isn’t anything wrong with either of our reproductive parts so we’ve been very chill about our “infertility” but our families have started to worry a lot. I haven’t felt great about lying as I do believe it’s a sin but my wife has been adamant about not telling anyone so I’ve respected that.  My wife has been doing amazingly in college and was accepted as a transfer student at a big university out of state a few months ago. We’re moving up there in august and planned to tell our families about our move today at church.  When we told them, our families were pretty sceptical but seemed accepting of our decision to move. But afterwards, my mom cornered us and outright asked us if we were using birth control and I just couldn’t lie so I told her yes. She immediately started crying and told my dad and my wife’s parents as well who also got visibly upset. As we drove home my wife was livid and said that I’d betrayed her trust. I don’t think that’s fair - I know she’s the one with the IUD but I see it as just as much MY secret as hers and lying to your loved ones just isn’t right in my opinion.  Our pastor just called me and said he’d come by in two hours. My wife i saying that she’s ready to pack her bags and leave town for good which I think is much too excessive. We both know that we aren’t coming back to our town after we move in august as the pressure of living how our parents want us to is  to much for us, but I don’t want to estrange my whole family in the process.  AITA?  Edit: guys, please be respectful about my family and their beliefs. Yeah, they’re much more conservative than we are but maybe don’t call me/my family lunatics/crazy people. Thanks.   UPDATE:  Thank you for all of your replies. I fully realize that I am the a-hole and that I shouldn’t have shared this information with anyone. However, I wouldn’t say I chose my mom over my wife as many of you are saying. Me telling my mom about the birth control was in panic rather than an active choice. I would always prioritize my relationship with my wife over anything as SHE’S the one I want to spend my life with, not my parents. I certainly screwed up though, I’m aware that my actions haven’t reflected my intentions.  Some more info: out of all my siblings, I have two brothers that are no longer on speaking terms with my parents due to leaving our religion, although I keep in contact with one of them. The other one chose to cut ties with all of us except for one of my sisters about 10 years ago and I only very occasionally hear about how he’s doing (according to my sister, he’s doing ok and got married a few years ago) but my other brother has been struggling immensely. That’s definitely why I’ve been so willing to give into my family’s expectations even though I disagree with so many of their beliefs.  My wife and I had a really long conversation after getting home last night, the content of which I’ll try to boil down:  I started off by apologizing for this major screwup. She then said a lot of what y’all have already said, that I need put first her first no matter what, that she’ll be the one who’s blamed for us not having kids even though we both made the decision etc.  In the end, she said that she forgives me which was the world’s biggest relief. However, she also said that she does not ever want to set foot in our church again. This hurt me a lot, but I also know that leaving the church will ultimately be for the best as the only way we could ever be accepted again would be to change our beliefs according to those of our parents.  I have a job starting August lined up in the town we’re moving to but my wife and I have agreed that we’ll both look into opportunities to find work up there immediately so we can push our move as much forward as possible. Shouldn’t be too big of a challenge for me as I work in a field with close to no unemployment.  All in all it looks like we’re leaving our community asap which is scary but hopefully going to be good for us.  UPDATE #2:  Our pastor didn’t come by last night. I called him up and told him we’d be leaving for a while to get some food and talk things over and while he initially said that he thought we could benefit from his spiritual guidance, he did back off after I declined.  He called me up about a half our ago and said he’d come over when I was home from work but I once again declined. My wife is currently at home packing our stuff so we don’t really want our pastor at our house right now. That’d probably mean that people from church would show up at our doorstep within the hour.  As for our parents, my mom sent me a really long text earlier talking about sin and how she didn’t want me ending up like the two of my brothers who abandoned our religion. Haven’t replied to that yet.', 'i don’t know where to start but i guess i’ll start by saying my husband and i have been trying to fall pregnant for nearly 5 years. i had twins at 20 (the father is not my husband) and after that i was told it would be hard to fall pregnant again (because of some other issues i had, as well as issues with my twin pregnancy). the twins are now 12 for info.   about a year ago we decided to just stop and look at other options. ultimately we decided against ivf etc. and go down the route of adoption. we put in our papers and everything and we were selected by a pregnant teenager with twins. it was surprisingly fast how we got picked (according to our lawyer) and we were so over the moon as well as my older twins.   last week we found out i’m pregnant. i’m almost 22 weeks so we found out very late. i wasn’t on birth control because of horrible side effects and the doctor told me i should be fine.   the twins are due in nearly 10 weeks but the doctor has told us that he will likely want to induce her nearing 32-35 weeks. if we cancel the adoption now i could not imagine what this poor teenage girl would go through. we talked to our lawyer and because of some law things that she probably will not be able to put the twins up for adoption until after they are born now. once the twins go up for adoption it could take up to a year for the twins to actually be taken off her. she has no baby equipment, anything etc. to prepare for these twins.   wibta if i cancelled our adoption?  tl;dr: hubby and i are planning to adopt newborn twins who are due in 2-5 weeks but we just found out i’m also pregnant. wibta if i cancelled the adoption?']","I'm on mobile so the formatting might be a bit shit.

1,1_meal_eating_eat_food,"['Throwaway since this was work related.  I (35M) was a review manager for a recent graduate (25F) who started working at our firm. Our industry is very fast paced with busy seasons and off seasons, we are expected to work 70plus hours per week during a three month period, including Saturdays.   Well, when the graduate started, she was amazing! She always asked insightful questions and worked past 70 hours a week, sometimes even coming in on Sundays. She was the best entry-level worker, and I could even see her easily becoming partner at the firm. We talked every day about work and personal life, since I would stop by her desk every morning when she arrived at work and then every evening before I left the office in case she had any questions or just wanted to chat.   Once busy season ended, I noticed that her productivity had dropped. Our work policy is 40 hours during the off season, but she was only working 35 hours and most of that time was spent on her phone. So, I mentioned this during our review meeting. Almost immediately after, she sent a note to HR asking to change review managers, and she even gave a list of BS examples like when she said her kitten and her cat weren\'t getting along, I said that we should bet which one killed the other. Or whenever the department went to lunch together, I\'d make a point to get everyone to use a plastic straw, since she\'s a huge climate change believer. Just dumb things where I\'ll admit I wasn\'t professional about, but they were just running jokes between us.   Well, HR told her no and suggested that I meet with her to try to smooth things over. So I suggested to her that we meet twice a week (nothing formal, just grab a casual lunch or a walk around the park near our office). She refused and then directly asked our boss if she could change review managers, and he said yes.  The next busy season, she barely reached 60 hours a week and had skipped several Saturdays. She avoided me, asked questions to the other managers, and whenever I came over to her desk to talk, her responses to me were short.   So I tried to shrug it off, but a few months after the end of busy season, she quit abruptly. Before she left, she went around talking to people, thanking them for the experience, etc. When she came to me, she said sorry for acting so distant, and told me why she changed review managers was because ""I teased her too much"". And she even said that I was creepy. I was shocked. I have a wife and five kids at home. And she was recently engaged. I was trying my best to be friendly and helpful as her mentor.  Anyway, this had happened a while ago. But it still bothers me so much, since I considered her a good friend of mine. I thought that I had done something horrible to her, but it was all because I teased her too much. However, my wife says that I could have act more professional. So reddit, AITA?  EDIT: Wow, this blew up! First, I want to address that I obviously believe in climate change. It was just a joke that almost everyone in the office was in on, and she was fine with it too. We like to tease her (and the other young coworkers) about being a millenial, since they seem to care so much about it. And I\'ve even seen her use plastic straws plenty of times.   I wanted to also say that in this industry, it is almost mandatory to work more than 60 hours a week. We have very generous PTO and people can WFH during the off seasons. It wasn\'t really that she was working less hours that bothered me, but that she didn\'t make an effort to help anyone else out when she wasn\'t busy. Our firm is like a family, and everyone should act as a team member.   Okay, but I get it. I will try to keep these things in mind for the next person I\'m mentoring. I only want to improve as a manager.', ' Last week, I was in a meeting to address an upcoming deadline.    The meeting was supposed to be extremely short and to the point. We all had other meetings afterwards. Missed deadlines could cost us millions.   As luck would have it, our meeting ended up running late about fifteen minutes.   When my manager asked if that was all, a coworker stood up and began talking about how his mosque was having an event to raise awareness about Islam. He even talked about post 9/11 harassment of Muslims at some point.  Normally, we wouldn\'t have cared- but some of us had flights to catch. Also, HR made it clear we were to never discuss religion or politics in the work place.   We glanced to the manager, but she seemed reluctant to interrupt him. I had a client waiting and I was cutting it close. I cut him off. ""Thanks! We\'ll let you know""   As we began rushing towards the door, he blocked me in.   ""Will I see you there?""   I told him I couldn\'t go. I had plans for St. Patrick\'s day. He kept trying to get me to change my plans. I said no. As he was walking away, he said a racist comment. ""You\'re probably not even Irish, just drink like one.""   I am part Irish. Being mixed race, people making digs about my heritage has always been a sore spot for me. I shot him daggers and he cowered away.   Due to his interruption, I was late to my next meeting. Thankfully, the client was very understanding.  After the client left, my boss asked why the meeting ran late and why I looked so frazzled. I told him about the invitation and the comments to me after. This did not sit with him. He is 100% Irish. He told me he would take care of it.   Later that day, people from the meeting started being called in to share their version of what took place. It turned out a coworker had missed their flight by just minutes.   The coworker eventually came by to apologize. He informed me he was worked up because he had family in New Zealand he hadn\'t been able to get in touch with.   Today, he is in New Zealand. His family member was one of the victims. He doesn\'t know that he has a severance package waiting when he comes back.   I feel terrible. He has a child on the way and his wife doesn\'t work. My boss is really well connected in the industry, so he is black listed in the state, if not the country.   My coworkers are glad he is gone, citing that they don\'t get special treatments when they have a death in the family, and he shouldn\'t either. They also brought up that he is kind of an asshole. He\'s had issues before. Trying to ban pork from the break room, trying to get female dress codes changed.   He certainly dug his own grave, but given the circumstances, I feel like his comments about the Irish is what ultimately did him in. My boss wouldn\'t have known if I hadn\'t told him. Am I the asshole?   TL:DR coworker made me late to meeting in order to invite me to a religious event and began harassing me. I told my boss, and now he is effectively blacklisted from the industry.  ', 'On Thursday, I (35M) had planned a stay at home Saturday with my GF (33F).  On Friday afternoon, my boss asked me if I was able to take care of an extra project that same Saturday at the office. It was going to be overtime and significant extra earnings for only a couple hours.  It\'s a business casual office.  I talked to GF later on Friday and told her I wanted to take advantage of the offer, but I felt guilty about our plans. I asked if she would be up for coming into my office with me to hang out while i worked, 2hrs tops, and then have our Saturday.    She was reluctant at first, she just wanted to relax, but I told her I was so into the idea of having her at the office with me, I would openly bribe her with a $150 Ikea gift card that I\'ve had lying around (she has previously asked if I could ""donate"" it as she is redoing her living room (live separately).  She immediately agrees on the additional condition of a morning coffee as well. I\'m totally fine with the stipulation. I told her to rest up and I would pick her up in the morning.  I left Saturday to pick her up and texted my boss I was headed in to the office shortly (there\'s an alarm thing so I thought it appropriate to give a heads up) my boss wrote back thank you and that they were going to stop in as well to pick up some files.  I arrived at GFs place and she comes out to the car in casual clothes. Flip flops, baggy sweat pants, one of my t-shirts.  It was supposed to be casual hang out Saturday and couch attire is the norm for those, but I remember feeling shock and little anxiety.  GF gets in the car and I said, I swear,  ""Hey, I\'m really sorry I didn\'t tell you earlier, but is there something a little less casual you could wear? I just found out my boss might stop by while we are there, I know this isn\'t cool of me to spring on you, but I want them to have a good first impression of you.""   She just looked at me and said ""No. You asked me to join you and this is what I want to wear today.""  ""I said ok, but could you do this for me? Even yoga pants or one of your gym outfits? I\'m worried about what my boss might think. Even just your shirt?""  ""I\'m not changing, you are barely dressed up either, so you can start driving or I am getting out"" [(I was in shoes, shorts, t shirt, and a zip up hoodie, I\'d describe it as walking the dog clothes?)](https://storage.googleapis.com/lulu-fanatics/product/35456/1280/lululemon-best-coast-hoodie-online-only-heathered-black-1966-214652.jpg)  I hesitated, and before I could say anything else she got out and went back in her house.  I have never asked her to change her appearance before and believe me, I will never make this mistake again, but I am I really the asshole?  TL/DR. Invited GF to office on Saturday (closed) to hang out while I worked overtime, she wanted to wear her pajamas, and I asked her to change to something less casual as the boss was going to stop by. I\'m currently in the dog house.  EDIT: included a link to pretty much what I was wearing, to try an clear it up.', ""Alright foremost I should say that I work temporarily in a university office where I do my work at a computer in the breakroom.   So today I get to work after volunteering for my school, which is put on party by my office (so everyone working there knows I was volunteering). I had to do landscaping work so i was wearing leggings and a tank top that dipped down a bit so my sports bra was partly exposed. I didn't have time to go home to change before work so sweaty clothes it was. I was working for a solid hour and then my boss comes and quietly tells me that this other worker complained that my attire wasn't appropriate. I was then forced to put on a baggy tshirt from the cardboard box in the corner. I was completely humiliated especially since there was another student in the room at the time.  No one ever gave me a dress code to follow yet this is the second time this situation has occured. My friend who works there even told me that girls are allowed to wear tank tops (which again I didnt know there was even a dress code). There is only one person in the entire office who has an issue and no one else cares. I can't even be seen by students coming in and out because of the location where I work.  I felt so sexualized, embarrased, and uncomfortable after that point that I left work early and called my mom crying. I am also sleep deprived so that might explain some of the crying ngl.  I seriously love my boss and he has told me he doesn't agree with this person yet he has to follow their will??? My mom and her coworker told me to contact HR and file a complaint but am I overreacting/ AITA???  Edit 1: I do want to say that normally student workers just show up in tshirts and shorts so it is far from a business casual workplace. Also yall I wasn't that sweaty to the point where my clothes were dirty or smelled.  Edit 2: The first time it occured my boss actually complimented my outfit so I assumed that it was only the one person who complained that had issue... not a real dress code  Edit 3: I have decided that I should take some responsibility and dress more appropriately in the future. Thank you to everyone who gave suggestions on how to make arrangements for having proper clothing in the future. I will be asking for the official dress code tomorrow. Honestly I'm glad I learned this lesson before I get into the real world."", 'background: i go to a selective school (a school you have to pass a test to get into) and i used to go to the same public school as this friend  We were talking about exam results and I was pretty proud of mine.

So i said “honestly you didn’t even do that well. you wouldn’t last a day at my school. that’s not even an A”  She got super mad and called me a bitch and a nerd or whatever and i just replied “my point still stands” and we kind of just stopped talking and left.   AITA for this? i feel like she deserved to hear it and to be taken down a peg but i may have overdone it
2,2_wedding_bride_engaged_fiance,"[""I started seeing a woman from Tinder. We've been talking for a few weeks. She's pretty and smart. First date went really well but it was on a Saturday afternoon. I'd had a wild night the night before so I had a a hangover and a headache. I told her I'm not normally so brain dead and she seemed to understand. We got on really well and agreed to see each other again.   Our second date was the week after, on Sunday. I had a wild Saturday night out which ended at 5am so I was hungover again and quiet. We agreed to see each other that day at 330. Because I've been working alot and partying a lot, I wanted to go to the gym to make sure I stay in shape. I felt alot of pressure because she has a really hot body. The gym was going to shut at 8 - I was on a time limit which meant I needed to leave at 530/6.  She seemed pretty weird when I told her I needed to leave so I could hit the gym. As we parted ways, I said I was sorry and said she could come with me to the gym. She said no. She was quiet and drumming her fingers and I could feel she was maybe annoyed. I apologised by text as soon as we left each other and suggested we cook dinner together at my place on a day when I'm not hungover.   She just texted me and said she's not interested in seeing me again.  AITA for these dates, reddit? I'm on a schedule and I want to let my hair down when I'm not working and I want to work out too.  Update (and edits for clarity) : so everyone is saying I'm TA for this and I'm getting personally criticised for my post history and the previous interaction with my ex. With this woman, I offered another date and she said no. This means I showed her I was interested even if I wasn't in the place to show it."", ""So I (25F) am getting married this October. Choosing my wedding party was tough because I had 3 really close friends growing up. One of them (Caty), was basically my best friend all throughout school. Caty, me, and our friend Lauren did everything together in high school. Later on, we became really close with Lauren's friend Anna as well. Caty and I were still close in college, but since then we've sort of drifted apart since we both went to grad school in different states. I see Lauren and Anna more frequently because they live close to me, but I don’t see Caty outside of planned get togethers. As a result, when I got engaged last fall, I asked Lauren and Anna to be in the wedding (Lauren’s the MOH), but I didn't ask Caty.  I didn't really think anything of it, but a couple months later, Lauren asked me if I'd talked to Caty. I said I hadn't and Lauren (gently) said that I should at least reach out to Caty since no one really understood why I’d excluded her from the bridal party. So I called Caty, we talked and she seemed really understanding about the wedding party. I also told Caty that she was really the only non-bridal party friend I wanted at the bachelorette party, but explained that I was afraid of drama with my cousin if I opened it up beyond the bridal party (my cousin’s a drama queen). It was easier to just say “bridal party only.” Caty said that if I wanted her to be there, she would love to come and I told her I hadn’t decided yet but I’d tell her when I did.  The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I didn't want Caty to feel more left out because she would be the only one in the bachelorette party who wasn’t in the wedding. So I told Lauren to go ahead planning the bachelorette party and to keep it wedding-party only. The thing is...I never actually told Caty I decided not to invite her.  So yesterday was my bridal shower and Caty, Anna and Lauren were all there. Later that night, we were hanging out at Lauren's house and Anna started talking about the bachelorette party. I guess she didn't know that Caty wasn't invited and assumed Caty was invited and going. Lauren was looking at me kind of panicked, but I didn't want to call attention to it and make it more awkward, so Anna kept talking about how much fun the bachelorette party was going to be. Caty didn't say anything, but eventually, she excused herself and when she came back, her eyes were really red. Still, she didn’t bring it up when she drove me home later so I figured she was probably fine.  So: AITA for not inviting her to the bachelorette party, and not telling her that she wasn't invited? I figured if she was there it would just be extra awkward because she'd be the only one not in the bridal party. But Caty didn't do anything wrong and I feel bad that she had to find out because Anna brought it up.  Edit: wow, ok, I get it. ITA. I can be pretty oblivious and I honestly didn’t think we were close anymore so I didn’t think she would care (also, with my cousin - I was at her bachelorette party so I wanted to be able to draw a clean line for why I wasn't opening up the bachelorette party, but other than that, i have no defense. I just hate confrontation). Clearly, though, I hurt her a lot more deeply than I thought. I’m going to call Caty tonight and apologize. I’d do it face to face, but I live in Virginia and she lives on the West Coast, so it’ll have to be by phone."", 'Context: My friend had gotten engaged in May last year and had asked me to be her maid of honor. I had said yes, thinking that it wouldn\'t go through (she had been engaged at least 3-4 times before and had never really gone anywhere). I told her to be careful and alert me ahead of the time since she wanted an late October wedding and I had college and could only move by bus.  About mid-September, things started to go wrong.  I had to ask a month before the color of the dress I needed for the event. My friend (Let\'s call her Ex) wanted a lilac dress. Lilac - a *spring* color -  in fall? I told her it would be hard, but I would do my best. Looked for a week, couldn\'t find one, so I found a purple one that wouldn\'t stand out too much.  The week after, my family was planning to go to our state fair that weekend, since it would be the last days. The day before our trip, I got a message from Ex saying *""We\'ll pick you and Lis* (my sister) *up at 6:30 tomorrow.""*  I didn\'t remember planning anything with her that day, so I texted her what that was about. Apparently it was her bridal shower that she had been planing for months. This was the first time I had heard of it. I even double-checked a list of wedding-related things I had kept in case I had actually forgotten. I Hadn\'t.  I told her I had had plans for tomorrow and had to figure out how my family and I would do. While trying to reorganize our schedules, Ex texted Lis that I was *abandoning her!* Had to explain that I was still going despite the sudden announcement, but my sister was going to stay home to finish a college paper due that Tuesday.  My friend was insistent that my sister go as well. It took me 8 minutes of explaining and re-explaining why Lis would not go until she finally gave up.  I went with her the following day for the bridal shower, which was just a meal at a restaurant with Ex, Ex\'s grandmother, and an Aunt of Ex\'s I had never heard of before. Ex ecstatically gave me a bracelet for being her maid of honor, they talked about how happy we were that she was getting married and how good her fiancee was (I had never meet the man, only talked to him for 10 minutes) . Overall it was an awkward and stressing affair.  3 days before the wedding, I got a message telling me the wedding venue was changed. This was an issue since I was gong by bus. I called her to try to find an alternate route. Ex found that the shortest route would require a 2 hour bus ride and a 25 minute car ride. There were 2 main issues with that. One: there was no one who could pick me up from the bus stop and Two: I would have to skip one of my classes to even make it there on time, making me miss vital information on one of my projects for finals. I was already going to miss half my class to make it to the original venue (1 hour 20 by bus, 15 min walking), I could not risk going on the new route - I was on academic thin ice (as in I could be kicked out of the college for a year if I failed). I scrambled to find a ride, to no avail.  Fearing her reaction, I cautiously sent Ex a message that I could not attend her wedding and that I hoped that their would not be any hard feelings.  I got a response a day later. Ex asked for the bracelet she had given me just 10 days prior. She followed that up with: ""*There will be hard feelings btw""*  That hit me pretty hard. After bending over backwards to do what I could for her wedding (and having 2 episodes I can only describe as akin to a panic attack) I had failed her. My best friend.  I talked to my parents, my 2 siblings and my counselor about the situation in hopes of some comfort and all my family told me the same thing: if Ex was being so self-centered as to not understand why I had to do what I did, it was time to reevaluate the relationship. And I did so for two weeks. After those two weeks, I sent Ex a message that our one-sided friendship was over and to not contact me again.  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: Friend was getting married, asked me to find a spring dress mid-autumn, invited me and my sister to her bridal shower last minute and guilt triped me into going and tried to do the same to my sister, changed the venue and got mad when I told her I couldn\'t go because it could get me kicked out of college and asked for the bracelet she gave me for being her maid of honor. Realized she was being selfish and that our relationship was one-sided and ended it 2 weeks after she got married.  Edit: This has not been the first time she has told me of an event the day before and/or guilt tripped me to go to one. Nor has it been the first time she had been adamant about her getting her way even if it inconvenienced me or someone else. These were not the only offenses, but they were the ones that made me re-evaluate my relationship. Essentialy, these were the straws that broke the camel\'s back', ""In 2015, I went through a pretty rough patch in my life. I was depressed and shut out all of my friends, family (2 parents + 7 siblings), and even my wife, Sarah. This period can be summed up with me breaking up with Sarah, lying to my family that we didn't get back together, and them finding out that we did get back together. I made a huge mistake and I apologized.  Now to the meat of the story. My family are not big fans of Sarah.* Yet, Sarah and I love each other very much, but we lived on different continents. Constrained by a work permit that fell through and an expiring visa, we got eloped and applied for her green card. This was decided and done within a week in January 2018. Afterwards, we told my parents and then told my siblings.  We also told them that we wanted to do a ceremony and reception in her European hometown in mid-August 2018. As a student, this was the best time. After hearing this, they were offended that I didn't include them in deciding a wedding date and location. I apologized that this was how it had to be.  In June 2018, we made the decision of cancelling and postponing the wedding due to issues with her green card. She ended up not getting it until October. I told my family that we would reschedule for the following summer in 2019 - around the 4th of July since this is when most of my family and friends would be off work.  After hand delivering the new wedding invites, emailing them wedding details, and calling them 1 month after the RSVP deadline, I found out that many of them weren't going. Some were angry that I was asking them if they were going to MY wedding. Some of them were upset/annoyed that I asked them why when they gave me their excuse.   Anyways, here are a few excuses:  * Wedding was cancelled last year so not sure about this year - no one was attending the original one. If they weren’t sure, why can’t they ask? * Too expensive - my family isn't rich but if they can afford a family of 3 - 5 to go to Asia and/or to vacation elsewhere for 2 - 3 weeks, I think they can afford one ticket to go to the wedding. I even offered to pay for their plane ticket.* * No time - along the same lines, if they can go 2 weeks somewhere, shouldn't they have a few days to go to the wedding? In addition, the reason why everyone was going to Asia was to visit grandparents. This was triggered by the passing of my maternal grandma last year. My grandma was sick for the previous two years; why didn't they go then? * No time to plan - in total, people knew about the wedding for over 1.5 years * We don't feel comfortable staying there * I wasn't sincere about my apologies * It was inconvenient * I deserved the family not going because of my past actions  Regardless, I'm extremely happy that my parents, 2 out of my 7 siblings, and 11 friends were at the wedding. However, I don't think what happened in the past warrants my 4 other siblings (1 had a legitimate reason) to skip their brother's wedding. They chose to not go to the most important day of my life. That hurts me the most. And for that, I want to cut them off.  So now that you know the backstory, WIBTA for feeling this way and for wanting to cut them off?  Updated with new details*"", ""Throwaway for obvious reasons  Okay so I'll give some necessary background information, I'll put an TL;DR at the bottom.  One of my friends is really rich, and the first of us to get married. We'll call her Mia from now on. In our friend group we have 'karen', now Karen has always been a bit defensive and hostile towards Mia. Not enough to have Mia notice this but enough for me to notice.  Mia never made a big deal about being rich, whenever we planned a girls night we would have dinner as places all of us could afford, but she would always cover us if needed. Her gifts for us were always personal, and it took Karen at least a year being in our friend group to discover Mia is rich.  Now upon hearing about Mia's engagement it came to no ones surprise that we would be her bridesmaids. Now I have to say I've known Mia the since high-school so I know that she has been low-key planning her wedding for years. So Mia is going all out, it will be a themed destination wedding. Now before anyone says anything about it being a destination wedding she will pay for anyone's travel expenses, she will also pay for all our custom made dresses.  Now here is the issue were I could the potential a-hole. Karen is one of the bridesmaids and I've heard through some other friends, that aren't invited to the ceremony, they are for the reception that takes place at a later date in our country so more people are able to attend. That Karen is badmouthing Mia to a lot of other friends, saying how she is unreasonable, spoiled and a b-word for wanting her dream wedding apparently. Now Mia has no idea yet, and might throw Karen out of the bridal party if she knows, Mia may be sweet but has a low tolerance for people who are nasty behind her back.  Now of course I don't want Karen to act like this to Mia, I'm not even sure why she is in our close friend group. Although I am not sure if it is my place to tell Mia about this.  So WIBTA if I tell Mia about Karen's behaviour and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.  TL;DR my friend is getting married and generous enough to pay for everything, another bridesmaid is being nasty behind her back and now I want to reveal the truth about her and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.  Edit: I'll talk to Karen first we are all going for drinks later so I get the chance to talk to her. You guys might be right it could indeed be a misunderstanding. I'll keep you guys updated on how it goes.  Update: okay so I made this post a few hours before seeing either Mia or Karen. Now I have a conclusion for the people who are interested. First off Mia knows, no I wasn't the one who told her. It was her fiancé, so apparently Karen uses her Snapchat as her personal diary and put a whole rant about Mia in her story forgetting that Mia's fiancé is friends with her on snap chat, maybe because he never sends her snaps.  So I went to the maid of honours house for girls night, where I find a crying Mia on the couch. You might ask what happened so let me tell you. Apparently Mia's question to Karen about which shade of blue she would prefer set Karen off so badly she went on a whole rant about Mia on her Snapchat story, saying about how awful she is, how the only reason she stays friends is because of a free vacation and all sorts of nasty stuff. Mia's fiancé sees this and tells Mia immediately, because who could blame him, this happened not even that long ago after I made this post. Well the Snapchat story was made in the afternoon the fiancé just saw it in the evening.  Now me, the maid of honour and the other bridesmaids were all hearing Mia out and comforting her, before Karen shows up. Now the maid of honour went off on her, which I can understand being Mia's best friend and discovering how Mia is being used. Karen now being full on thrown out of our friend group, sees this moment as an opportunity to tell us all off. Blaming Mia's fiancé and saying how he had no right to share this, because that's why you posted in on Snapchat I really don't see Karens logic in this but okay.  Now the truth is out in the open, I was fully prepared to talk to Karen first because it could have been a misunderstanding. But I didn't even got the chance to, thanks to everyone telling me to talk to Karen to make sure it weren't just nasty rumours, even though it wasn't necessary in the end I still appreciate it.

3,3_friends_talk_relationship_girlfriend,"['Me (28M) and my wife (26F) have been together for 3 years. When we first met, we were just hooking up and she told me the second night we hooked up that she sells naked photos of herself. I told her that’s fine. About 3 weeks into us hooking up, she told me she wanted to stop selling naked photos of herself because she wanted me to be the only person to see her naked. That was the starting off point for our relationship, it made me realize we actually really liked each other.  The fact that she sold naked pictures didn’t cross my mind for the first few months of us dating until I realized she’s still friends with some of the guys she sold pictures to. I told her I was uncomfortable with that, but she told me the ones she’s still friends with she was friends with before she sold naked pictures to them and she didn’t feel right ending a friendship with them just because they bought pictures from her and now she has a boyfriend. She also said that she doesn’t mind that I’m friends with girls I’ve hooked up with or wanted to hook up with, so what’s the difference. I think of it as different than someone she hooked up with, it’s like these guys were her customers. She’s not really close with any of them as friends, but they interact on various social media platforms here and there.  This is been an issue on and off in our relationship. I’ll forget about it for months and then I’ll think about it and it makes me uncomfortable. It always starts a fight between us because I’ll get really closed off/not affectionate when I think about it and she feels like I’m making her feel ashamed for the fact that she sold naked pictures of herself. I’ve tried to not think about it, but it still crosses my mind.   We’ve been having fights about it these last few days because I told her I don’t want her to talk to anyone she’s sold pictures to. I didn’t say she has to, but in an ideal world I would want her to not interact with them. She said she barely even talks to them, they just occasionally respond to an Instagram story she’ll post or like a tweet of hers. She said it would be rude to cut out her friends and, again, that I’m free to talk to girls I’ve hooked up with. All of this came to a head today when I said what it comes down to is that I’m embarrassed that she sold these kind of pictures. This upset and angered her. She said why did I tell her I was fine with it when we started hooking up, and I told her that truthfully I wasn’t really fine with it then either, I just didn’t want to seem uncool or judgmental. She’s hurt now and says she’s going to have a hard time getting over this because she feels like I’m shaming her.   TLDR: my wife sold naked pictures of herself while we were just hooking up. she stopped before we started dating but it bothers me that she still interacts with guys who were her friends who bought pictures. today I told her I’m embarrassed that that she sold naked pics and she’s upset ', 'backstory, my ex (we\'ll call bitch, petty but i don\'t care), we hooked up for about 2 months before she dumps me and returns to her ex, which means i was played as a rebound. I\'m a really nice person as a whole, and it\'s hard for people to really piss me off because i never take anyone\'s threats seriously but if you get on my nerves i become the most petty nightmare, and it never ends because you\'re officially put on the ""shit list"" for me.  for the year after the breakup i didn\'t talk to her, talk about her, do anything that has to do with anything remotely close to her... until a few weeks ago where she started talking about me behind my back.  i tried messaging her, i was blocked... i messaged her best friend, she tells me that she\'s been spreading lies everywhere about the breakup and me lying about a few things... and thus, i got royally pissed.  first, i established a close friendship with her best friend a her only ticked for a visa to a different country, and ended that friendship as her friend now hates her guts too.  went off to talk to another friend that she just made up with after causing her trouble too, now she broke that friendship too.  i made a half-hour long video explaining everything including screenshots of texts and voice notes and call recordings and sent it to everyone that she knows and know her.  then i decided to fuck with her boyfriend\'s brain until he grew paranoid of her.  her being an introvert means that she can\'t make friendships here, and me destroying whatever what\'s left of her friendships made me feel like an asshole, but a justified one.  so, i leave the question to you, fellow redditors, am i an asshole in this situation?  ---  **EDIT**: for some that didn\'t read the whole thing.  * it\'s been a year since the breakup. * i have not made any contact nor have talked about her for that past year. * i already have another girlfriend, i already moved on. * i only did this because she is known to do this and more for attention. * now 2 weeks and 3 days, i have yet to hear anything from her nor any lies from her.  this didn\'t happen right after the breakup, it\'s a year after the breakup.  and i probably should\'ve explained a bit more, i am hard to piss off generally due to me not really caring that much about people being either childish or whatever (comes with the job of being an I.T tech, a lot of people think they know it all and you\'re just scamming people). the only times i even got pissed off were when someone does something accidentally that ticks me off pretty well, but usually an apology remedies everything and all is well, no trouble.  it\'s the assholes that take it further after seeing me getting pissed off, and on this ""shit list"" there\'s literally 3 of them, not even joking!', ""I started seeing a woman from Tinder.

So when I showed him a picture of my girlfriend he immediately recognized her as the girl who ghosted him almost ~~a month ago~~ two weeks ago (girlfriend confirmed that) from the same dating app. While he said it was a shitty thing what she did to him, especially since she led him on in a way (would flirt with him and say they should meet up but she\'d always be busy). They talked for about a month. He said he would support my relationship with this girl if it went better than it did for him, but he said he didn\'t want her near him for the time being, as he said he was pretty hurt she did that to him and moved onto his friend instead.  So for the next week he\'d make jokes every time I brought her up. I asked why he was being so jealous, he said he wasn\'t, he was, ""using humor as a way to cope with me rubbing salt on the wound"". He told me he honestly felt like hurt about it all, so me constantly talking about wasn\'t helping, he was happy for me and all that but he couldn\'t rub that feeling away.  Flash forward about two weeks, I had started dating that girl for a few days, we were on a ""date"" when I get a call saying my friend is in the hospital. His mom explained that he was being tailgated and got hit in the rear. He was injured pretty bad but not life threatening. I tell my gf what\'s up and without thought rush to the hospital. I get there and nobody else was in the room, his mom was there but she was down in the cafeteria. My friend, still kind of dazed looks up, squints and sees my gf and goes, ""I must be dead because I\'m seeing fucking ghosts now, just kidding, what\'s up"".  I had enough of this bullshit from him, him and my girlfriend laughed, but I pulled her away and said we\'re leaving. My girlfriend was confused and asked what happened. I\'m sick of the constant ghosting jokes and all that. I don\'t know if this is his way of coping but it\'s ridiculous. He\'s salty.  My friend called me to apologize, he said he thought it was funny and mixed with the injuries, he just blurted it out. But he also says he didn\'t want her near me and I should\'ve respected that, but he didn\'t make a big deal out of it so imo he didn\'t seem to care. So AITA in this situation or did I over-react?  EDIT: I\'m the asshole apparently.', ' Last week, I was in a meeting to address an upcoming deadline.    The meeting was supposed to be extremely short and to the point. We all had other meetings afterwards. Missed deadlines could cost us millions.   As luck would have it, our meeting ended up running late about fifteen minutes.   When my manager asked if that was all, a coworker stood up and began talking about how his mosque was having an event to raise awareness about Islam. He even talked about post 9/11 harassment of Muslims at some point.  Normally, we wouldn\'t have cared- but some of us had flights to catch. Also, HR made it clear we were to never discuss religion or politics in the work place.   We glanced to the manager, but she seemed reluctant to interrupt him. I had a client waiting and I was cutting it close. I cut him off. ""Thanks! We\'ll let you know""   As we began rushing towards the door, he blocked me in.   ""Will I see you there?""   I told him I couldn\'t go. I had plans for St. Patrick\'s day. He kept trying to get me to change my plans. I said no. As he was walking away, he said a racist comment. ""You\'re probably not even Irish, just drink like one.""   I am part Irish. Being mixed race, people making digs about my heritage has always been a sore spot for me. I shot him daggers and he cowered away.   Due to his interruption, I was late to my next meeting. Thankfully, the client was very understanding.  After the client left, my boss asked why the meeting ran late and why I looked so frazzled. I told him about the invitation and the comments to me after. This did not sit with him. He is 100% Irish. He told me he would take care of it.   Later that day, people from the meeting started being called in to share their version of what took place. It turned out a coworker had missed their flight by just minutes.   The coworker eventually came by to apologize. He informed me he was worked up because he had family in New Zealand he hadn\'t been able to get in touch with.   Today, he is in New Zealand. His family member was one of the victims. He doesn\'t know that he has a severance package waiting when he comes back.   I feel terrible. He has a child on the way and his wife doesn\'t work. My boss is really well connected in the industry, so he is black listed in the state, if not the country.   My coworkers are glad he is gone, citing that they don\'t get special treatments when they have a death in the family, and he shouldn\'t either. They also brought up that he is kind of an asshole. He\'s had issues before. Trying to ban pork from the break room, trying to get female dress codes changed.   He certainly dug his own grave, but given the circumstances, I feel like his comments about the Irish is what ultimately did him in. My boss wouldn\'t have known if I hadn\'t told him. Am I the asshole?   TL:DR coworker made me late to meeting in order to invite me to a religious event and began harassing me. I told my boss, and now he is effectively blacklisted from the industry.  ']"," Last week, I was in a meeting to address an upcoming deadline.    The meeting was supposed to be extremely short and to the point. We all had other meetings afterwards. Missed deadlines could cost us millions.   As luck would have it, our meeting ended up running late about fifteen minutes.   When my manager asked if that was all, a coworker stood up and began talking about how his mosque was having an event to raise awareness about Islam. He even talked about post 9/11 harassment of Muslims at some point.  Normally, we wouldn't have cared- but some of us had flights to catch. Also, HR made it clear we were to never discuss religion or politics in the work place.   We glanced to the manager, but she seemed reluctant to interrupt him. I had a client waiting and I was cutting it close. I cut him off. ""Thanks! We'll let you know""   As we began rushing towards the door, he blocked me in.   ""Will I see you there?""   I told him I couldn't go. I had plans for St. Patrick's day. He kept trying to get me to change my plans. I said no. As he was walking away, he said a racist comment. ""You're probably not even Irish, just drink like one.""   I am part Irish. Being mixed race, people making digs about my heritage has always been a sore spot for me. I shot him daggers and he cowered away.   Due to his interruption, I was late to my next meeting. Thankfully, the client was very understanding.  After the client left, my boss asked why the meeting ran late and why I looked so frazzled. I told him about the invitation and the comments to me after. This did not sit with him. He is 100% Irish. He told me he would take care of it.   Later that day, people from the meeting started being called in to share their version of what took place. It turned out a coworker had missed their flight by just minutes.   The coworker eventually came by to apologize. He informed me he was worked up because he had family in New Zealand he hadn't been able to get in touch with.   Today, he is in New Zealand. His family member was one of the victims. He doesn't know that he has a severance package waiting when he comes back.   I feel terrible. He has a child on the way and his wife doesn't work. My boss is really well connected in the industry, so he is black listed in the state, if not the country.   My coworkers are glad he is gone, citing that they don't get special treatments when they have a death in the family, and he shouldn't either. They also brought up that he is kind of an asshole. He's had issues before. Trying to ban pork from the break room, trying to get female dress codes changed.   He certainly dug his own grave, but given the circumstances, I feel like his comments about the Irish is what ultimately did him in. My boss wouldn't have known if I hadn't told him.

4,4_pets_pet_dogs_dog,"[""This happened almost a year ago. Some people say yay some people say nay. Let's see what yall think  I went to live with this friend last August for a few weeks while I was dealing with a health issue that needed to be monitored. During this time her dog had an unplanned litter of puppies. She sold all but 3 that July so 3 puppies and the mother was left. We live in the south, days here are 100+ degrees farenheit with 100% humidity. It's hot. Friend couldnt deal with her dog and 3 puppies and so they lived outside 24/7 without shelter, only dirty water (she would change it maybe once a week) and food tossed on the ground for them to eat maybe every other day. When I started living there I encouraged her to allow her dogs to spend more time inside. Even if it's in their crates anything is better then being out in the heat (these are long coated German shepherds) She wouldnt hear me out and say they piss and shit in her house and she cant deal with the noise. I started bringing them inside when she wasnt home and trying to make the backyard better for them. I started demanding that she sells all the puppies or give them away before she deployed in September. Another friend of mine (call her W) and I adopted two of the puppies. Leaving the mom and one puppy to be under friends control. I tried my hardest asking around for anyone to take the last puppy. I even went as far as saying I'd pay the fee friend wanted for it to go to a good home. Fast forward a few days. My new puppy and Ws puppy are shitting blood, puking, not eating. They are lifeless. We rush them to the emergency vet to find out they have an awful case of hookworms. Normally not a big deal if caught early, but this was end stage. My puppies gums were white. She needed a blood transfusion, all the stuff. W and I ended up paying around 1500 dollars each in vet bills. I called friend, who was already on her deployment at this point. And said I needed to take the other two dogs to the vet but first I would need her credit card number or she needs to call the vet to give them her number ahead of time as I cannot front the bill.  She refused.  After another week and watching the last puppy dying in the backyard whilst trying to get friend to pay the bill I had enough. I asked her husband (seperated) if I could get rid of the puppy and if he could pick up the mom. He agreed. He took the mom and I ended up taking the puppy to the shelter were she got care and was adopted a month later.   I ended up moving out and friend broke all ties with me. Friend complained to some coworkers who say it was wrong of me to take the puppy to the pound. What do yall think? Aita?"", '...or is my cat the asshole?   His name is PJ (Patrick Jr., after my husband) but mainly we call him Pidgey. He’s always been a real 10 of a guy; a real cat to brag about. He greets me at the door when I get home from work every day, he is always down for a cuddle and he doesn’t seem to know that his claws and teeth could be used for violence against humans. Seriously, you could pick him up and toss him around and he’d just meow at you. Not that I would ever do that. He’s my precious Pidgey.   But, in other news, fuck Pidgey. Because as much as I really do love him, he sucks. I understand that cats can develop territories, and lately Pidgey has adopted the upstairs bathroom and hallway. However, this seems to apply only between the hours of 5- 7AM.   Every weekday morning it’s the same: my alarm goes off and I sneak out of my lovely warm bed. Already, Pidgey is on the other side of the door meowing like it’s his job to wake me up or I’ll sleep forever. And no, before you even suggest it, he’s not hungry. The first thing I do is go downstairs and feed him; he ignores the food completely and runs right back upstairs to bother me in the bathroom.   You know those tear-jerking videos of dogs greeting their owners after long absences? It’s like that, every morning, only it’s 5:30 AM and I’m fucking tired and trying to get ready. I cannot deal with him every single morning. He puts out his paw in this cute little pantomime of “pet me pet me!” and I just do not have it in me. Don’t get me wrong, I pet the shit out of the little bastard, but it’s never enough. I get in the shower, he sticks his head through the curtain and meows at me. I get out, soaking wet, and he covers my wet legs in cat hair before I can dry off. I brush my teeth and he jumps up on the sink and bumps my hand. Cat hair everywhere, and no amount of petting settles him down.   The rest of the day, he’s a normal chill cat. He’s upstairs right now, being chill. If I go up there, he’ll come over and say hi, but where’s all the intensity? Right now I’m sitting downstairs on the couch with a perfectly good open lap and two hands that could be used for petting (if I weren’t currently shit-talking him online), but no. It has to be the only time of day when I’m on a time constraint and otherwise unable to give him the attention he demands.   I could shut the bathroom door, of course. But such a good boy deserves my love, doesn’t he? He’s a good boy. Every time I growl “enough!” and rudely toss him off the bathroom sink, I feel like an asshole. He seems to have gotten it into his head that this is the only time of day he can receive love, and he goes after it with the intensity of a drowning man. It seems so sad to deny him. Should I just accept the fact that this is his love language and set my alarm earlier to make time for Pidgey? Or is he a fucking asshole who needs to fucking chill?  Edit: said kitchen, meant bathroom  Edit 2: as this post has gotten more replies I realize some vital information is missing. So, for clarity’s sake and to maintain the integrity of voting:  A) Pidgey is a Tonkinese boy, which is very similar to a Siamese, which explains the temperament.  B) Pidgey has a sister, Molly. She’s no star in the personality department like he is, but she keeps him company when we’re not around.  C) We recently had a baby who takes up a lot of our attention. This is most likely the root cause of his actions. He is still very much loved. This is not a case of “if you don’t have time for a pet, you shouldn’t have a pet!” He’s just used to being King Boi around these parts.', 'My stepdaughter is very allergic to dogs. She\'s asthmatic, and living in a house with them is making her breathing problems worse. She\'s been hospitalised twice in 6 months, and 5 times this year. We\'ve tried everything, from keeping the dogs as away from her with air purifiers to sectioning off areas of the house. Nothing has worked.  Allergy shots aren\'t an option for medical reasons. BM got the judge to agree that she can\'t live in a house with dogs, and it is abusive and harmful. It could literally kill her. We would legally be charged with her death if we keep the dogs and the worst happens.  My two dogs and my husband\'s dog are our babies. My husband is willing to re-home his dog, but I can\'t do it. They\'re 4 and 6 and won\'t be able to be adopted. They will be put down if I surrender them. I\'m sobbing just thinking about it. We just had a baby, so me moving out with the dogs isn\'t really an option.   We\'ve had to settle on moving to every other weekend with my husband taking SD to a hotel for now. I feel horrible about this but I don\'t know what option we have. I can\'t risk my dogs\' lives, and I can\'t risk my stepdaughter\'s life. BMs friends and family are gloating that they were right to tell BM that 50/50 was just a temporary inconvenience she\'d have to deal with. DH is incredibly down about this and feels like he\'s abandoning SD. I\'m trying to justify it by reminding myself that we live two hours away, so by the time SD was school age, someone would need primary custody anyway, but it\'s not helping.  Edit so that I\'m not ""arguing in the comments"":   We didn\'t know SD existed when we married, and paternity wasn\'t confirmed until she was a little over a year old. BM was basically a friend with benefits. I did not go into marriage knowing I had a stepchild or would be a stepparent.  She was hospitalised 5 times this year, which I\'ll admit was a lot. BUT, we didn\'t know exactly why. The first time, we just thought it was a bad attack. BM started screaming about the dogs, but the allergy wasn\'t fully confirmed, and I\'m not going to immediately put down my pets on the word of a stranger who has every reason to lie. After visit 2, we confirmed the allergy, and we were making steps to reduce allergens AS RECOMMENDED. After visit 3, we doubled down and tried making the dogs outside dogs, but it didn\'t help and wasn\'t viable as they bark. After visit 4, the court summons happened. Visit 5 is very recent.', 'My girlfriend and I have been talking about getting a dog for a while now. She wants a tiny little lap dog, while I want a dog that I can actually play with that I don’t have to treat like it’s made out of porcelain. Our house will only suit one dog, so our wants for different dog breeds are quite problematic.  She will absolutely not change her mind about this. It’s either the tiny dog or no dog. I’ve tried to show her breeds like labradors and Great Danes that are super friendly and are gentle giants, but she refuses to even consider them.  I asked her what her deal with bigger dogs was. She told me that when she was a little girl, her cousin’s labradoodle dog knocked her over and pinned her down, while she screamed for help. I asked if it had hurt her, but she said no, that it was only trying to play with her. She told me that it was terrifying for her, and that she’s been scared of bigger dogs since (I did not know this before).  I told her that it’s okay, we will be different dog owners. Apparently her cousin’s dog was untrained and would jump up on people, trying to play all the time. I told my girlfriend that I will absolutely take sole responsibility for its training. I would take it to puppy school, walk it every day and that it can help to overcome her fear of big dogs.  We eventually got into an argument about this. She is very adamant about her decision, and when I tried to come up with different breeds like a German shepherd or a breed that is middle-sized, she said that she doesn’t want a dog anymore and that she’s happy with just the cats, since I won’t listen to her concerns (yet she won’t consider ANYTHING that I’m saying??)  I was very frustrated and told her she needs to get over her past bad experience with a big dog since it didn’t hurt her—it was just being a dog and trying to play with a kid! She has been ignoring me since and I don’t think she’ll let this go.  AITA?', 'Throwaway account because people from our town would know who we are.  My wife and I were both brought up in very conservative christian homes. We’ve known each other since early childhood and were married three years ago at 19. We’re both christians but neither of us are anywhere near as conservative as our parents and don’t plan to lead the same type of lives as they have. Our marriage is great, we love each other a great deal and always talk about how we feel.  Anyway: We told everyone that we weren’t going to prevent pregnancies when we were married but as my wife had just started college and neither of us felt ready to start a family, my wife had an IUD. Up until today, we’ve told everyone that we’re trying but that God just hasn’t given us a baby yet. Obviously there (most likely) isn’t anything wrong with either of our reproductive parts so we’ve been very chill about our “infertility” but our families have started to worry a lot. I haven’t felt great about lying as I do believe it’s a sin but my wife has been adamant about not telling anyone so I’ve respected that.  My wife has been doing amazingly in college and was accepted as a transfer student at a big university out of state a few months ago. We’re moving up there in august and planned to tell our families about our move today at church.  When we told them, our families were pretty sceptical but seemed accepting of our decision to move. But afterwards, my mom cornered us and outright asked us if we were using birth control and I just couldn’t lie so I told her yes. She immediately started crying and told my dad and my wife’s parents as well who also got visibly upset. As we drove home my wife was livid and said that I’d betrayed her trust. I don’t think that’s fair - I know she’s the one with the IUD but I see it as just as much MY secret as hers and lying to your loved ones just isn’t right in my opinion.  Our pastor just called me and said he’d come by in two hours. My wife i saying that she’s ready to pack her bags and leave town for good which I think is much too excessive. We both know that we aren’t coming back to our town after we move in august as the pressure of living how our parents want us to is  to much for us, but I don’t want to estrange my whole family in the process.  AITA?  Edit: guys, please be respectful about my family and their beliefs. Yeah, they’re much more conservative than we are but maybe don’t call me/my family lunatics/crazy people. Thanks.   UPDATE:  Thank you for all of your replies. I fully realize that I am the a-hole and that I shouldn’t have shared this information with anyone. However, I wouldn’t say I chose my mom over my wife as many of you are saying. Me telling my mom about the birth control was in panic rather than an active choice. I would always prioritize my relationship with my wife over anything as SHE’S the one I want to spend my life with, not my parents. I certainly screwed up though, I’m aware that my actions haven’t reflected my intentions.  Some more info: out of all my siblings, I have two brothers that are no longer on speaking terms with my parents due to leaving our religion, although I keep in contact with one of them. The other one chose to cut ties with all of us except for one of my sisters about 10 years ago and I only very occasionally hear about how he’s doing (according to my sister, he’s doing ok and got married a few years ago) but my other brother has been struggling immensely. That’s definitely why I’ve been so willing to give into my family’s expectations even though I disagree with so many of their beliefs.  My wife and I had a really long conversation after getting home last night, the content of which I’ll try to boil down:  I started off by apologizing for this major screwup. She then said a lot of what y’all have already said, that I need put first her first no matter what, that she’ll be the one who’s blamed for us not having kids even though we both made the decision etc.  In the end, she said that she forgives me which was the world’s biggest relief. However, she also said that she does not ever want to set foot in our church again. This hurt me a lot, but I also know that leaving the church will ultimately be for the best as the only way we could ever be accepted again would be to change our beliefs according to those of our parents.  I have a job starting August lined up in the town we’re moving to but my wife and I have agreed that we’ll both look into opportunities to find work up there immediately so we can push our move as much forward as possible. Shouldn’t be too big of a challenge for me as I work in a field with close to no unemployment.  All in all it looks like we’re leaving our community asap which is scary but hopefully going to be good for us.  UPDATE #2:  Our pastor didn’t come by last night. I called him up and told him we’d be leaving for a while to get some food and talk things over and while he initially said that he thought we could benefit from his spiritual guidance, he did back off after I declined.

5,5_roommate_roommates_apartment_bedroom,"['So the problem is like this. I live in a rented apartment, with a friend from work (lets call him A) for 3 years now. We know each other from college, but really got friends when we moved together in a new city. Now the apartment has 2 bedrooms, one for each of us ( he insisted he wants the bigger one, I didn\'t care that much and let him have it) and a somewhat spacious living room. We pay equally the rent, with me doing the actually pay and all the effort done to discuss any damages that happen, any roads to facilities or stuff like that, while my friend pays half and that\'s about it, 0 effort and expects for everything to be done for him like he is entitled. Some friends of mine decided they would like to visit me in the weekend (one of my best friends from high school together with his gf and 2 of her friends ). A leaves almsot every Friday to visits his gf and returns late Sunday.  I discussed with him if my hometown friends can visit and stay in our apartment, he was OK with it and said he is thinking if anyone can sleep in his room (that was last week). Wednesday comes and i ask him again about it and he vehemently says no, that his room is not ""prepared"" to have guests and that he is om with people coming in the house, but they are not to sleep in his bed/room. Meanwhile another of my best friends from highschool decided to join totaling 5 people to be accommodated in my bed and a lousy couch in the living room, that can barely accommodate one person and with little time for my friends to rent something cheap to sleep through the weekend while visiting me.  He refuses to have guests in the house, if the house is dirty or not cleaned, while he is lazy (we both are) to clean most of the time. He hates people getting in his apartment while its not clean with such a passion, he declines instantly any visit no matter how far the person has traveled to see him or how rare that ever happens. That\'s his quirk, its either clean or no visit. I know about this quirk, we had another similar fight some time ago, thats why I asked him before hand to clean up or to at least tell me with some time ahead if will do that or not, so that my friends can find something to rent. Thursday he didn\'t have the time or the mood to clean and thats why he declined my requests to have the 2 girls sleep in his room.  I ""was forced"" to let the couple sleep in my room, me and my other high-school bestie slept on the couch and the other 2 girls slept in my friends(A) room. He now accuses me that I broke boundaries, his trust and that I was an asshole for not even asking him in the last moment. I believe its his own fault for taking to long to decide.  We are in a pretty big fight about this whole incident. AITA for letting the girls sleep in his bed?   TLDR from above: My flat mate of 3 years is pissed at me that i let 2 girls sleep in his room even tho i asked him ahead of time to let the girls know if they should rent a room or stay in our apartment.  ', ""In a couple months, my (18F) boyfriend (20) is moving out of his college dorm and into an apartment, which he'll share with two roommates. (I'm friends with both of them.) Officially, I'll continue living in a dorm next year. But I plan to use my room as a study space during the day, and spend a lot of time at my bf's apartment--sleep there every night, eat breakfast and dinner there, spend the weekends there--probably as much time as he and his roommates will spend there.  We're both enthusiastic about this prospect, but I feel bad about essentially being an additional, non-rent-paying occupant of the apartment. My family and scholarships (not me) are paying for my dorm, and I'm getting a job next semester, so I could use my own money to contribute to the rent, although my boyfriend has said I don't need to do that. His parents will be paying for his rent, but I know at least one of the roommates will be using his own money.  I feel like a freeloader because four people will be living in this apartment, but only three of them will be paying their fair share, some of them with the earnings of their own hard work. So WIBTA?  EDIT for more info: I haven't yet talked to the roommates, but I will ask them what they want. Both of them have girlfriends who will also spend a significant amount of time in the apartment; I don't know what arrangements those couples have made as far as the girlfriends chipping in.  I am definitely going to pitch in with household chores! I'll do my fair share of taking out the trash, buying toilet paper, tidying up, etc., whether I contribute to rent or not, and I'm also planning to make some meals for everyone. I should have mentioned that earlier.  UPDATE: I talked to the roommates. They are okay with me staying whenever without paying rent (utilities are included in rent) as long as I help with chores, pay for any utility overages I incur, and don't create clutter. After reading the comments, I will probably not stay there every night, so they don't get tired of me. I would definitely be an asshole if I just crashed at their place whenever I felt like it without asking them. But I asked them what they wanted, and they said they're fine with me staying there without paying rent as long as I follow their rules. So all is good now. (I hope, haha--we'll see how it goes!)"", ""I’m a 21 year old living with my parents and my two younger brothers (both in elementary school). My schedule consists of working ~8 hour shifts Tuesday, Thursday, and weekends, while having class for 8 hours on MWF. This does not account for time spent on homework.   I pay my parents $150 in rent every month because they claim to be struggling with bills and I can’t afford my own place only working ~30 hours a week on $11/hour.   However, they seem to be doing fine, buying new beds and televisions and generally blowing money on unnecessary things.   Since I pay for my own car insurance, gas, tolls (necessity, unless I want to use double the gas and take 90+ minutes to get to school), and phone bill, I’m stretched thin on money as is. I’m barely able to save for when I’m out of school, let alone spend money on anything during my little free time.  So given the situation, if I asked them to hold off on asking for rent, would I be an entitled asshole? Or would that be reasonable?  Edit: The general consensus so far is that yes, I am the asshole. I felt so when I first posed this question to myself, but I wanted some outside opinions. While I don’t agree with the attitude some have presented, I understand the judgement. I have lived on my own before, and I understand that it can be much worse. However, I personally feel like that money would be much better put towards my loans before they start gaining interest.   Edit2: I'm thoroughly convinced that half of you are not reading the entire post. I am aware that this is not a lot of money as far as rent is concerned, I lived on my own for over a year when we first moved into this state, but I was not in school.   When my classes started, my parents asked me to move back in with them, knowing that I wouldn't be able to work enough while in school to pay for a full apartment's worth of rent.

Thanks again to everyone who isn't just insulting me."", 'I live in a 2 bedroom apartment. We’re all close friends. I live with my male roommate Gus. My housemate Don lives with his girlfriend Ava. I’ve been friends with Ava years before Don met her. I don’t have a girlfriend at the moment. Don left town for two days. Last night, Gus was in town but not in the apartment when this happened. I was watching movies on Netflix with Ava. We both sat on the couch. She got tired of sitting and first laid her head on the armrest of the couch and put her feet on my lap. That got uncomfortable after a while so she laid her head on my lap and put her feet on the armrest. She asked for permission both times.    Gus came back while we were in that position and asked us why she was lying her head on my lap. We said that nothing weird happened and Ava said her back hurt from sitting too long so had to lie down and putting her head on the armrest was uncomfortable. Gus asked us what movie we were watching. After Ava told him, Gus said he wanted to watch so Ava sat up and let Gus sit in the middle of the couch between us. Nothing to note happened until today morning when Don returned.    While I was still asleep, Gus told Don about our position on the couch when he came back to the apartment. When I woke up and went to the living room, Don and Ava were there. Don said Gus told him what happened and that was very inappropriate of us. Don said he lost respect in me. I thought it wasn’t a big deal at all, but I apologized anyway to Don for letting that happen but made it clear that nothing more happened and nothing like that will happen again. Ava apologized to me for getting me in this mess. I assumed Ava already got a stern talking from Don and apologized to him. I’ll talk to Gus about his snitching when I see him.', ""   Back in college I roomed with 3 guys. One was never there, one I got along with really well, and the third was a bit different from the rest of us.  I imagine the third guy was somewhere on the spectrum but we never asked or treated him different because of it, and the year went pretty smooth all in all.  The roommate who I got along with and I would drink a lot through the year, mostly sitting around the apartment playing video games or watching sports. We'd come up with random little drinking games whenever one of us had a good idea.  The roommate who didn't talk with much had a habit of coming downstairs into the living room and just standing there. He wouldn't say anything, just stand there and watch us, watch the TV, not much else. There wasn't much furniture and we did invite him to sit the first few times, but he just shrugged it off.  One day when he came down to his spot, I had a an idea for a drinking game, whenever he comes downstairs, secretly start a timer and for every 30 seconds he's there without moving or saying anything, take a drink.  I will admit, not the best idea I've ever had, but we never told him we were doing this, we just kept an eye on timer and took a drink every uninterrupted 30 seconds.  I mentioned this to my wife the other day and said I was kinda an A-Hole for doing this.  Again, not saying it was the best idea I ever had, but it was a victim less game. AITA?""]","I’m a 21 year old living with my parents and my two younger brothers (both in elementary school). My schedule consists of working ~8 hour shifts Tuesday, Thursday, and weekends, while having class for 8 hours on MWF. This does not account for time spent on homework.   I pay my parents $150 in rent every month because they claim to be struggling with bills and I can’t afford my own place only working ~30 hours a week on $11/hour.   However, they seem to be doing fine, buying new beds and televisions and generally blowing money on unnecessary things.   Since I pay for my own car insurance, gas, tolls (necessity, unless I want to use double the gas and take 90+ minutes to get to school), and phone bill, I’m stretched thin on money as is. I’m barely able to save for when I’m out of school, let alone spend money on anything during my little free time.  So given the situation, if I asked them to hold off on asking for rent, would I be an entitled asshole? Or would that be reasonable?  Edit: The general consensus so far is that yes, I am the asshole. I felt so when I first posed this question to myself, but I wanted some outside opinions. While I don’t agree with the attitude some have presented, I understand the judgement. I have lived on my own before, and I understand that it can be much worse. However, I personally feel like that money would be much better put towards my loans before they start gaining interest.   Edit2: I'm thoroughly convinced that half of you are not reading the entire post. I am aware that this is not a lot of money as far as rent is concerned, I lived on my own for over a year when we first moved into this state, but I was not in school.   When my classes started, my parents asked me to move back in with them, knowing that I wouldn't be able to work enough while in school to pay for a full apartment's worth of rent. I do my own laundry, keep my area clean, pay for my own food, gas, car insurance, tolls, EVERYTHING.   I know how to manage my money, but when you're in class 24 hours per week and working another 28-30, the amount of gas and toll payments skyrocket. And no, there aren't any alternatives to my route, not without doubling or tripling the amount of time it takes me to get anywhere.  Thanks again to everyone who isn't just insulting me."

On the way into the area, the head guide explained to the group (maybe about 30 people) that the monument is considered sacred by the local Native American tribe and that they do not approach it closely. He went on to say that, though the park service cannot legally bar us from going right up to it, they ask that we be respectful and do not. The assistant guide who physically traveled with us to the monument itself was Native American, presumably from the tribe in question.  &amp;#x200B;  Next to the monument, there\'s actually a smaller monument that\'s of some significance to my family, which can only be seen from up close. My friend and I started to walk towards it, when the assistant guide noticed us and told us not to. My friend countered that the rule about staying away was just a request and that we wanted to see the smaller monument. The guide repeated that we were not allowed to, then went to talk to some of the other tourists in the group. We went anyway, and when the guide noticed, he chased after us, saying, ""Hey, you\'re going to get us all into trouble."" After we got to the smaller monument, the guide said, ""Okay, you saw it, now please move away."" We complied, and nothing more came of the incident, though it was clear that he wasn\'t happy with us.  &amp;#x200B;  My friend privately defended our actions to me, as he himself use to give that exact tour in an official capacity as part of the park service. He said that, during both his tenure and prior to it, it was commonplace for people to approach the monument. He speculated that the rule about staying away is either new or else depends on the whims of who is guiding the tour.', ""I have a small office on side street with a parking lot in the front. Next door, there's a vacant commercial property. It faces the main road and has a partially wooded area in the back. Basically, the front of our office looks out onto our parking lot, the side of the building next door, and the wooded area.\xa0   About a month ago, a woman in an SUV started parking in either our lot or the wooded area of the property next door. She does this every day and stays there for hours at a time (at least 3 or 4). She always has a small dog with her and gets out to walk it every once in a while. The rest of the time, she just sits on her phone.\xa0   During the first couple of weeks, people in my office tried to say hello or ask if they could help her. She straight-up ignored them. But she did stop parking in our lot and began only parking behind the building next door.\xa0   After about 3 weeks, we called the police to report a suspicious person. They came out and talked to her, then talked to us. They told us she has a valid license with no outstanding warrants, so there's nothing they can do because she's on private property and not obstructing a roadway. She told them her sister lives in an apartment close by and she's been staying with her. However, the sister's apartment doesn't allow pets, so she comes up there to walk her dog.\xa0   After the police visit, she stopped parking there for a couple of days. But now she's doing it again. At this point, it's been just over a month total. I thought she would find a new spot after the police came out, but she hasn't.   It makes no sense. There's no free Wi-Fi access around and no easy access to a bathroom. There's a library, fast food restaurants, and grocery stores all literally within a mile of our office.   I do think she's staying with the sister because her vehicle isn't loaded down with possessions. My best guess is the sister won't let her stay in the apartment by herself. Maybe the sister doesn't want to get in trouble if management comes by and hears the dog barking and she isn't there.\xa0   This situation has just gotten annoying. We're tired of looking outside and seeing her big SUV in our direct line of sight. She doesn't pick up after her dog, and it's getting warmer outside. We occasionally leave our office door open to get some fresh air in nice weather, but we can't lately because of the um, aroma.\xa0   I know which apartment complex her sister lives in. I also happen to know the owner of the property next door. So, my question is WIBTA if I either notified: (1) the apartment complex that one of their tenants has someone with a dog staying there (and give them her vehicle description and plate number); or, (2) the owner of the vacant property so they can have a trespass warning issued against her? Which of these would be the better option? Or is there a 3rd option that would be better? I'm not trying to get her in trouble, but I also don't understand why she insists on parking there.  Edit: See update in the comments. She's a junkie."", 'UPDATE: The fence is done, it is a massive construction set atop a completely unnecessary retaining wall type base. It is almost 9 feet tall and reaches to the eaves of my house. I guess now I know why the bid was so high! 3 extra board feet of height beyond what they told me they planned! The kicker is that all the dirt they dug up to put in the postholes went on their side of the fence, so I now have a ditch where I once had a gentle slope upward.  My elderly neighbor\'s boomer kids decided that we need a fence between our properties where there hasn\'t been one since the homes were built 60 years ago.  They asked if that was okay and I said sure. We talked about maybe splitting it and I said I was open to that.   Cut to a week later and they\'ve dig the postholes. They keep saying they\'ll get a couple of bids. I keep saying I need to see what we can afford because we are financially limited since buying the home. They keep saying things like ""We\'ll get a good bid!"" When I ask them generally what fences cost.  Cut to a week later and they\'re ready to start. They bring me a bid for almost 5k, expecting me to pay half. Theres no ""couple of bids"" or any discussion of a budget, etc. I had even indicated I\'d be happy to do some of the labor but they didnt take me up on it.  I said nevermind, this is way too much for me and suggested they put the fence on their side of the boundary so they can ""own"" it completely. But they chose to go ahead and do it anyway without any further discussion. So now I\'m hiding in my house feeling half like an asshole and half like an asshole boomer just tried to pressure me into giving him 2500 dollars.  Info: In my state both owners are responsible for a boundary fence, but the party that initiates is supposed to give 30 days notice along with estimated costs all in writing. So legally I\'m okay. But am I an asshole? Did I lead them on?  EDIT: I upvoted everyone who was outraged about me calling them boomers, because that\'s hilarious and you lot are hilarious. And it does detract from my main question.  EDIT: Since so many are asking its 55 ft of fence, my boundary only.', 'Throwaway account because people from our town would know who we are.  My wife and I were both brought up in very conservative christian homes. We’ve known each other since early childhood and were married three years ago at 19. We’re both christians but neither of us are anywhere near as conservative as our parents and don’t plan to lead the same type of lives as they have. Our marriage is great, we love each other a great deal and always talk about how we feel.  Anyway: We told everyone that we weren’t going to prevent pregnancies when we were married but as my wife had just started college and neither of us felt ready to start a family, my wife had an IUD. Up until today, we’ve told everyone that we’re trying but that God just hasn’t given us a baby yet. Obviously there (most likely) isn’t anything wrong with either of our reproductive parts so we’ve been very chill about our “infertility” but our families have started to worry a lot. I haven’t felt great about lying as I do believe it’s a sin but my wife has been adamant about not telling anyone so I’ve respected that.  My wife has been doing amazingly in college and was accepted as a transfer student at a big university out of state a few months ago. We’re moving up there in august and planned to tell our families about our move today at church.  When we told them, our families were pretty sceptical but seemed accepting of our decision to move. But afterwards, my mom cornered us and outright asked us if we were using birth control and I just couldn’t lie so I told her yes. She immediately started crying and told my dad and my wife’s parents as well who also got visibly upset. As we drove home my wife was livid and said that I’d betrayed her trust. I don’t think that’s fair - I know she’s the one with the IUD but I see it as just as much MY secret as hers and lying to your loved ones just isn’t right in my opinion.  Our pastor just called me and said he’d come by in two hours. My wife i saying that she’s ready to pack her bags and leave town for good which I think is much too excessive. We both know that we aren’t coming back to our town after we move in august as the pressure of living how our parents want us to is  to much for us, but I don’t want to estrange my whole family in the process.  AITA?  Edit: guys, please be respectful about my family and their beliefs. Yeah, they’re much more conservative than we are but maybe don’t call me/my family lunatics/crazy people. Thanks.   UPDATE:  Thank you for all of your replies. I fully realize that I am the a-hole and that I shouldn’t have shared this information with anyone. However, I wouldn’t say I chose my mom over my wife as many of you are saying. Me telling my mom about the birth control was in panic rather than an active choice. I would always prioritize my relationship with my wife over anything as SHE’S the one I want to spend my life with, not my parents. I certainly screwed up though, I’m aware that my actions haven’t reflected my intentions.  Some more info: out of all my siblings, I have two brothers that are no longer on speaking terms with my parents due to leaving our religion, although I keep in contact with one of them. The other one chose to cut ties with all of us except for one of my sisters about 10 years ago and I only very occasionally hear about how he’s doing (according to my sister, he’s doing ok and got married a few years ago) but my other brother has been struggling immensely. That’s definitely why I’ve been so willing to give into my family’s expectations even though I disagree with so many of their beliefs.  My wife and I had a really long conversation after getting home last night, the content of which I’ll try to boil down:  I started off by apologizing for this major screwup. She then said a lot of what y’all have already said, that I need put first her first no matter what, that she’ll be the one who’s blamed for us not having kids even though we both made the decision etc.  In the end, she said that she forgives me which was the world’s biggest relief. However, she also said that she does not ever want to set foot in our church again. This hurt me a lot, but I also know that leaving the church will ultimately be for the best as the only way we could ever be accepted again would be to change our beliefs according to those of our parents.  I have a job starting August lined up in the town we’re moving to but my wife and I have agreed that we’ll both look into opportunities to find work up there immediately so we can push our move as much forward as possible. Shouldn’t be too big of a challenge for me as I work in a field with close to no unemployment.  All in all it looks like we’re leaving our community asap which is scary but hopefully going to be good for us.  UPDATE #2:  Our pastor didn’t come by last night. I called him up and told him we’d be leaving for a while to get some food and talk things over and while he initially said that he thought we could benefit from his spiritual guidance, he did back off after I declined.  He called me up about a half our ago and said he’d come over when I was home from work but I once again declined. My wife is currently at home packing our stuff so we don’t really want our pastor at our house right now. That’d probably mean that people from church would show up at our doorstep within the hour.  As for our parents, my mom sent me a really long text earlier talking about sin and how she didn’t want me ending up like the two of my brothers who abandoned our religion.

My husband came home from doing some errands, we chatted for a bit in our kitchen, leaving our son to play on his own like we always do in an adjacent-but-not-in-eyesight room. He usually watches TV for a bit after his snack, it\'s been the routine for a year now. Color us surprised when he managed to unlock the front wooden door, open it, unlock the front glass door, and open it, get down our porch all without us noticing. We noticed after about 10min and we freaked out. 911 and 3hr later, he\'s brought home from a few blocks away: full of mud but otherwise O.K.  I\'m not asking if we were the assholes for not paying attention, because I know we full well were. I do want to ask about our neighbor though and if me blowing up at her was justifiably assholish. After we had our baby back, she piped in to the police officers with us in earshot ""oh I saw him running across the street, I thought he was playing so didn\'t do anything"". She detailed she knew our kid got out unattended (and did nothing), what direction he went in (and told no one), and previously said she had no idea about anything (lying to cops and us).  I don\'t get along with my neighbor. She somehow has four cars to their household and frequently parks in our driveway. We don\'t have a car ourselves. It\'s been a constant battle over the last five years to get her to stop. She\'s retaliated, too, but I think this time goes too far. I exploded at her and would have got physical were the police not there.  While I know we should have been more attentive, what my neighbor did was outright malicious. AITA for exploding at her?

Haven’t replied to that yet.', 'So in my school we have advisory class every Tuesday for 40 minutes. I usually wouldn\'t mind if it weren\'t for this one big kid who has horrible hygiene. Whenever he walks into the room, his smell permeates the room, and I have a sensitive nose and can\'t handle it. Breathing through my shirt is hard.  I tried telling my advisory teacher but she said, ""you\'re just gonna have to deal with it.""  Well I dealt with it alright. I used to put essential oils on my nose/shirt to block his smell, but one day I forgot them and he smelt especially bad, so I wrote on a whiteboard by the door ""Showers are beneficial! Take one today!"" because I\'ve had enough. I don\'t have to put up with someone else\'s lack of hygiene.  2 days later, I get implicated with two other people for bullying and talk with the assistant principal. I explained that I don\'t know who the other two people are, and that when I wrote what I did, I had no ill intent, and tried to assertively but anonymously tell him to shower, because he has bad hygiene.  The assistant principal then told me that he could have bad odor due to illness or digestion, and she let me off with a warning.  Illness? You still need to shower. Digestion? Still need to shower, and change up your diet.  I didn\'t say anything else to him and I got transferred to another advisory. But he still has a bad odor. Like as if he learned nothing.  What\'s the verdict?', 'background: i go to a selective school (a school you have to pass a test to get into) and i used to go to the same public school as this friend  We were talking about exam results and I was pretty proud of mine. My friend is a bit up herself and she thinks she’s top shit - always has - and she attends the public school i used to go to.   She was talking about how she did really well (she mostly did okay not too great but good by her standards) and I was kind of tired of hearing it even though i was happy for her. I said i did okay but since my tests are harder (because of the school i go to) i should be scaled up pretty well. I didn’t mean for it to come off as rude but she got this huge attitude about it.   She started saying something along the lines of “yeah we know you go to that smart school” and then started saying how it was bullshit because she did really well without needing to attend one and called it a joke.   This kind of pissed me off because i worked really hard to even get in and it’s highly stressful trying to compete with the top level students. So i said “honestly you didn’t even do that well. you wouldn’t last a day at my school. that’s not even an A”  She got super mad and called me a bitch and a nerd or whatever and i just replied “my point still stands” and we kind of just stopped talking and left.   AITA for this? i feel like she deserved to hear it and to be taken down a peg but i may have overdone it', 'A major essay was supposed to be due today.  I spent many weeks reorganizing my life so that I could finish this thing on time and do a good job.  &amp;#x200B;  Last night (the night before it is due) the professor announces that ""due to some requests"" the deadline has been postponed by 5 days.  He clearly thought he was doing everyone a favor and nicely hinted ""use this time wisely!""  &amp;#x200B;  I wrote him an email (the tone bordered between polite and frustrated) stating that while his gesture was certainly compassionate for students who wanted more time, it frustrates people who like me who worked really hard to hit this deadline.  I requested that, in the future, he should award bonus marks to students who still hit the original deadline.  &amp;#x200B;  I am usually a quiet student who doesn\'t speak up... this is my first time raising such an issue.  AITA for wanting some reward based on the situation?  EDIT: Due to frequent questions, I\'ll add some details below:  * essay has been an ongoing project for months * deadline was known since the start of the semester * deadline was changed just 6 hours before the original due date with explaination ""due to some requests"" and nothing more * my positition is to keep the extended deadline, but offer a small incentive for students who are able to submit by the original deadline  Final EDIT:  I think reddit has spoken.  I was indeed the asshole, and didn\'t understand the difference in deadlines for academic settings versus my job.  I stand corrected and thanks everyone for sharing your points of view. ']","Throwaway account because people from our town would know who we are.  My wife and I were both brought up in very conservative christian homes. We’ve known each other since early childhood and were married three years ago at 19. We’re both christians but neither of us are anywhere near as conservative as our parents and don’t plan to lead the same type of lives as they have. Our marriage is great, we love each other a great deal and always talk about how we feel.  Anyway: We told everyone that we weren’t going to prevent pregnancies when we were married but as my wife had just started college and neither of us felt ready to start a family, my wife had an IUD. Up until today, we’ve told everyone that we’re trying but that God just hasn’t given us a baby yet. Obviously there (most likely) isn’t anything wrong with either of our reproductive parts so we’ve been very chill about our “infertility” but our families have started to worry a lot. I haven’t felt great about lying as I do believe it’s a sin but my wife has been adamant about not telling anyone so I’ve respected that.  My wife has been doing amazingly in college and was accepted as a transfer student at a big university out of state a few months ago. We’re moving up there in august and planned to tell our families about our move today at church.  When we told them, our families were pretty sceptical but seemed accepting of our decision to move. But afterwards, my mom cornered us and outright asked us if we were using birth control and I just couldn’t lie so I told her yes. She immediately started crying and told my dad and my wife’s parents as well who also got visibly upset. As we drove home my wife was livid and said that I’d betrayed her trust. I don’t think that’s fair - I know she’s the one with the IUD but I see it as just as much MY secret as hers and lying to your loved ones just isn’t right in my opinion.  Our pastor just called me and said he’d come by in two hours. My wife i saying that she’s ready to pack her bags and leave town for good which I think is much too excessive. We both know that we aren’t coming back to our town after we move in august as the pressure of living how our parents want us to is  to much for us, but I don’t want to estrange my whole family in the process.  AITA?  Edit: guys, please be respectful about my family and their beliefs. Yeah, they’re much more conservative than we are but maybe don’t call me/my family lunatics/crazy people. Thanks.   UPDATE:  Thank you for all of your replies. I fully realize that I am the a-hole and that I shouldn’t have shared this information with anyone. However, I wouldn’t say I chose my mom over my wife as many of you are saying. Me telling my mom about the birth control was in panic rather than an active choice. I would always prioritize my relationship with my wife over anything as SHE’S the one I want to spend my life with, not my parents. I certainly screwed up though, I’m aware that my actions haven’t reflected my intentions.  Some more info: out of all my siblings, I have two brothers that are no longer on speaking terms with my parents due to leaving our religion, although I keep in contact with one of them. The other one chose to cut ties with all of us except for one of my sisters about 10 years ago and I only very occasionally hear about how he’s doing (according to my sister, he’s doing ok and got married a few years ago) but my other brother has been struggling immensely. That’s definitely why I’ve been so willing to give into my family’s expectations even though I disagree with so many of their beliefs.  My wife and I had a really long conversation after getting home last night, the content of which I’ll try to boil down:  I started off by apologizing for this major screwup. She then said a lot of what y’all have already said, that I need put first her first no matter what, that she’ll be the one who’s blamed for us not having kids even though we both made the decision etc.  In the end, she said that she forgives me which was the world’s biggest relief. However, she also said that she does not ever want to set foot in our church again. This hurt me a lot, but I also know that leaving the church will ultimately be for the best as the only way we could ever be accepted again would be to change our beliefs according to those of our parents.  I have a job starting August lined up in the town we’re moving to but my wife and I have agreed that we’ll both look into opportunities to find work up there immediately so we can push our move as much forward as possible. Shouldn’t be too big of a challenge for me as I work in a field with close to no unemployment.  All in all it looks like we’re leaving our community asap which is scary but hopefully going to be good for us.  UPDATE #2:  Our pastor didn’t come by last night. I called him up and told him we’d be leaving for a while to get some food and talk things over and while he initially said that he thought we could benefit from his spiritual guidance, he did back off after I declined.  He called me up about a half our ago and said he’d come over when I was home from work but I once again declined. My wife is currently at home packing our stuff so we don’t really want our pastor at our house right now. That’d probably mean that people from church would show up at our doorstep within the hour.  As for our parents, my mom sent me a really long text earlier talking about sin and how she didn’t want me ending up like the two of my brothers who abandoned our religion. Haven’t replied to that yet."
